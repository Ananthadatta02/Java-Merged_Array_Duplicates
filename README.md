# Java-Merged_Array_Duplicates
This Java program merges two user-input arrays and identifies duplicate elements in the merged array. It first takes input for two arrays, merges them, and then checks for duplicate values using a nested loop. The program efficiently displays duplicate elements, helping in array analysis and data handling.
